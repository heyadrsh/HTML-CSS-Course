# HTML & CSS Course Readme

This repository contains the project I completed as part of an HTML & CSS course I took. In this course, taught by Simon, also known as SuperSimpleDev, I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and gained practical knowledge through hands-on projects.

## Project: YouTube Homepage

As part of the course, I developed a YouTube homepage using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to recreate the look and feel of the YouTube homepage, including its layout, styling, and responsive design. By working on this project, I was able to apply the concepts and techniques I learned throughout the course.

The project showcases various skills I acquired during the course, including:

- Creating the basic structure of a webpage using HTML.
- Styling elements using CSS selectors, classes, and IDs.
- Implementing responsive design to ensure the webpage looks good on different devices.
- Utilizing CSS Flexbox or Grid to create a dynamic layout.
- Incorporating media queries to adapt the page's layout for different screen sizes.
- Adding interactivity through CSS animations or transitions.
